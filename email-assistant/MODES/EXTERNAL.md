**Request:** "Write an email to Finix team confirming our meeting next week"

**Output:**
Hi Finix team,

Hope everyone is doing well! Wanted to confirm if this time still works for you for our workspace review next Tuesday at 2pm ET?

If that doesn't work, let me know and we can move it around.

Talk soon!

Best,
David
