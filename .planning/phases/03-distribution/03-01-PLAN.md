<objective>
Create distribution package for team installation of the email follow-up skill

Purpose: Enable non-technical team members to install the skill on Claude Desktop or Claude Code following clear instructions
Output: email-follow-up.zip containing skill folder with SKILL.md and README.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update SKILL.md signature and create distribution folder</name>
  <files>SKILL.md, email-follow-up/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
1. Update the signature in SKILL.md from "David" to "[YOUR NAME]":
   - Find the Signature Configuration section near bottom (~line 531)
   - Change `Best,\nDavid` to `Best,\n[YOUR NAME]`
   - Also update line 312 (default signature reference) from "David" to "[YOUR NAME]"

2. Create distribution folder structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p email-follow-up
   ```

3. Copy updated SKILL.md to distribution folder:
   ```
   cp SKILL.md email-follow-up/
   ```

The generic [YOUR NAME] placeholder makes it obvious team members need to customize, per CONTEXT.md decisions.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `grep -n "YOUR NAME" SKILL.md` shows both signature locations updated
- `ls email-follow-up/` shows SKILL.md exists
- `grep "YOUR NAME" email-follow-up/SKILL.md` confirms placeholder in distribution copy
  </verify>
  <done>SKILL.md has [YOUR NAME] placeholder; email-follow-up folder contains copy of SKILL.md</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create README.md with installation instructions</name>
  <files>email-follow-up/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md inside email-follow-up/ folder with:

```markdown
# Email Follow-Up Skill

Generate professional follow-up emails from Gong call transcripts.

## Installation

### Claude Desktop / Claude Web

1. Click your profile icon (bottom left corner)
2. Go to **Settings** > **Capabilities**
3. Click **Upload skill** and select this ZIP file
4. Find "gong-follow-up-email" in the Skills list and toggle it **ON**

### Claude Code

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Copy the `email-follow-up` folder to `~/.claude/skills/`
   ```
   cp -r email-follow-up ~/.claude/skills/
   ```
3. Start a new Claude Code session

Note: Skills do not sync between platforms. Install separately on each platform you use.

## Changing Your Signature

The default signature is "Best, [YOUR NAME]". To change it:

1. Open SKILL.md in a text editor
2. Find the "Signature Configuration" section near the bottom
3. Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your name
4. Save and re-upload (Desktop) or restart session (Code)

Or just edit the signature when you paste the email into Gmail.

## Usage

Paste a Gong transcript and say "generate a follow-up email from this transcript"
```

Keep it minimal per CONTEXT.md: text steps only, no screenshots, no troubleshooting section.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `cat email-follow-up/README.md` shows complete installation instructions
- Verify Claude Desktop section has 4 steps
- Verify Claude Code section has 3 steps
- Verify signature customization section exists
  </verify>
  <done>README.md exists with clear installation instructions for both platforms and signature customization guidance</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create ZIP distribution package</name>
  <files>email-follow-up.zip</files>
  <action>
Create ZIP with CORRECT folder structure (critical per RESEARCH.md pitfall #1):

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/david.cogan@postman.com/Downloads/emailSkill

# Create ZIP containing the folder (not loose files)
zip -r email-follow-up.zip email-follow-up/

# Verify structure is correct
unzip -l email-follow-up.zip
```

Expected output should show:
```
email-follow-up/
email-follow-up/SKILL.md
email-follow-up/README.md
```

NOT:
```
SKILL.md
README.md
```

The folder wrapper is REQUIRED for Claude Desktop to find the skill.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `unzip -l email-follow-up.zip | grep "email-follow-up/"` shows folder structure
- `unzip -l email-follow-up.zip | grep "email-follow-up/SKILL.md"` confirms skill is inside folder
- `unzip -l email-follow-up.zip | grep "email-follow-up/README.md"` confirms README is inside folder
- File count should be 2 files + 1 directory
  </verify>
  <done>email-follow-up.zip exists with correct folder structure (skill folder at root, not loose files)</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:

1. **ZIP structure verification:**
   ```bash
   unzip -l email-follow-up.zip
   ```
   Must show `email-follow-up/` folder containing `SKILL.md` and `README.md`

2. **Signature placeholder verification:**
   ```bash
   unzip -p email-follow-up.zip email-follow-up/SKILL.md | grep -A1 "Default:"
   ```
   Must show `[YOUR NAME]` not `David`

3. **README completeness:**
   ```bash
   unzip -p email-follow-up.zip email-follow-up/README.md | grep -c "##"
   ```
   Should show 4 sections (Installation, Desktop, Code, Signature, Usage)

4. **Cross-platform readiness:**
   - Same SKILL.md works for both Desktop (ZIP upload) and Code (folder copy)
   - README has separate instructions for each platform
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 3 is complete when:
- [ ] email-follow-up.zip exists in project root
- [ ] ZIP contains email-follow-up/ folder (not loose files)
- [ ] SKILL.md inside ZIP has [YOUR NAME] signature placeholder
- [ ] README.md provides 3-4 step installation for Desktop and Code
- [ ] README.md explains signature customization
- [ ] Package is ready for Slack/email distribution to team
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-distribution/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
