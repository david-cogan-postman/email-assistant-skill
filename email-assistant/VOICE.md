### Category A — External Professional

**Sample A1 — Postman x Razorpay — follow up**

Hi [RECIPIENT], thanks for your time today! Great to reconnect.

Following up on our conversation with a few notes:

Publisher Analytics

Access via your workspace analytics tab - the company-level API usage data is live now

Error tracking by domain could be useful for your team to catch documentation issues

Notebooks

I'll record a quick walkthrough showing the Agent Mode generation flow (should hopefully address the duplication concern)

Passing along your feedback on embedding the interactive capability in your own docs

MCP & Agent Mode

I'll share the prompt gallery materials once finalized for your AI PM

Pricing

Free plan goes from 3 users to 1 user starting March 1 (with a free Team trial month after that)

Since you're already using a distribution list to login, you should be fine on the new free plan

Publisher analytics stays available regardless

Let's reconnect in a few weeks to see how things are going. Happy to help with any questions!

Best,
David

### Category B — Cold / Warm Outreach

**Sample B1 — Datadog outreach / sync + MCP publishing**

Hi [RECIPIENT],

Nice to meet you, hope 2026 is treating you well! I'm David Cogan, Publisher Success Manager on the Postman API Network team. I work closely with @Felipe Martinez, who I believe you worked with on the [COMPANY] workspace.

I'm reaching out because I'd love to learn more about what's on your roadmap and see where the API Network can better support your 2026 goals.

On our end, we've recently shipped a few publisher capabilities I'm excited to share:

Interactive notebooks that let developers follow hands-on API walkthroughs directly in Postman

A revamped analytics experience with domain-level consumer data, so you can see which organizations are discovering and using your APIs

Support for MCP server publishing, which enables developers to connect your tools to AI agents

On that last point, our Partnerships team has been in touch with yours about a potential launch collaboration for our upcoming Agent Mode feature. Publishing your MCP server in your workspace is crucial to that integration. The launch conversation has gone quiet, but I'd love to pick it back up if there's still interest, or revisit post-launch once you're further along with MCP publishing.

Would you have 30 minutes to connect in the next couple weeks? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
David

**Sample B2 — MongoDB outreach / sync + MCP publishing**

Hi MongoDB team,

Hope 2026 is treating you well! I'm David Cogan, Publisher Success Manager on the Postman API Network team. It's been a while since our teams have connected.

I'm reaching out because I'd love to learn more about what's on MongoDB's roadmap and see where the API Network can better support your 2026 goals.

On our end, we've recently shipped a few publisher capabilities I'm excited to share:

Interactive notebooks ...

A revamped analytics experience ...

Support for MCP server publishing ...

On that last point, we're gearing up to launch Agent Mode... We would love to include MongoDB. You already have an MCP server that would be a great fit, and I'd love to discuss getting it published and collaborating on Agent Mode use cases.

Would you have 30 minutes to connect in the next couple weeks? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
David

### Category C — Internal Team

**Sample C1 — GitHub thread (internal + partner coordination)**

Hi folks,

Sam, bringing the rest of the team back onto the thread. Confirming that GitHub is now verified on the API Network.

We are working on those example "running start" prompts - keep the team posted.

Best,
David

(earlier messages in thread:)

Perfect, thank you Iryna! Confirming that all looks good from our end as well.
I just asked my team to flip the 'Submit for Review' button live ...
Would it be possible for you or Sam to please hit the button and confirm?
Once you hit the button, it'll trigger a request on our end...


**Sample C2 — Notion (coordination; internal CCs)**

Hi Ting Ting, MJ and team! How is everyone doing?

Reaching out re: Agent Mode launch prompts. We'd love to start testing ASAP - would it be possible to please share your proposed prompts with us this week?

Happy to help with questions!

Best,
David
