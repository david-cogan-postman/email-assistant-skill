# Milestone v1.0: Publisher Follow-up Email Skill MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-21
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a Claude skill that transforms Gong transcripts into professional follow-up emails for Postman's Publisher Success team. The journey progressed from a working single-file skill (Phase 1) through robust handling of real-world edge cases (Phase 2) to team-ready distribution (Phase 3).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Single-File MVP

**Goal**: User can paste a Gong transcript and receive a professional, ready-to-send follow-up email

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements**: EXTR-01, EXTR-02, EXTR-03, EXTR-04, GEN-01, GEN-02, GEN-03, GEN-04, GEN-05, CONF-01, CONF-03, DLVR-01, DLVR-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can paste Gong transcript into Claude and receive a structured follow-up email
  2. Email includes extracted participant names, action items, and resources from transcript
  3. Resources appear as hyperlinked text (e.g., "verification checklist") not raw URLs
  4. Email uses configurable signature (default: "Best,\nDavid")
  5. Missing information shows clear [PLACEHOLDER] markers instead of hallucinated content

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create complete SKILL.md with extraction, generation, and few-shot examples

**Completed:** 2026-01-21

### Phase 2: Robust Handling

**Goal**: Skill handles incomplete transcripts gracefully and suggests relevant Postman resources contextually

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Requirements**: CONF-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Skill auto-activates reliably when user pastes transcript (no manual /skill-name invocation needed)
  2. Skill generates useful email even when transcript is incomplete (missing names, partial action items)
  3. Skill suggests relevant Postman documentation links based on call context (verification, notebooks, Run in Postman, etc.)
  4. Attachment reminder appears when transcript mentions "deck", "presentation", "PDF", or "attached"

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Add activation detection and ask-then-generate clarification protocol
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Add Postman resource library with contextual matching and attachment detection

**Completed:** 2026-01-21

### Phase 3: Distribution

**Goal**: Team members can install and use the skill in their preferred Claude environment

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Requirements**: PLAT-01, PLAT-02, PLAT-03, DIST-01, DIST-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Identical SKILL.md works in both Claude Desktop (ZIP upload) and Claude Code (~/.claude/skills/)
  2. Non-technical team members can install skill following setup instructions
  3. ZIP package includes all necessary files and clear installation steps
  4. Team members can customize signature without editing skill logic

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Create ZIP distribution package with SKILL.md and installation README

**Completed:** 2026-01-21

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Ask-then-generate protocol: Never block email generation; questions are additive (better UX)
- Three-tier activation detection: Clear/ambiguous/none invocation logic for flexible but intentional activation
- Two-condition attachment rule: Requires PRESENTATION + SHARING words to reduce false positives
- Embedded resource library: Curated 13 URLs instead of dynamic search (faster, more accurate)
- Generic [YOUR NAME] signature: Makes customization need explicit for team
- ZIP folder structure: Must contain folder at root for Claude Desktop compatibility

**Issues Resolved:**

- None — clean execution across all phases

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None
