# Cold/Warm Outreach Mode

This mode generates introduction and outreach emails to new contacts.

## When This Mode Activates
- User explicitly requests "cold outreach" or "intro email"
- First contact with a new company
- Re-engagement after long silence ("It's been a while since...")

## Voice Calibration
- Formality: 5-6/10 (approachable, informative)
- Typical length: 120-220 words
- Opening: "Hi [Name]," + role intro + reason for outreach
- Structure: Short intro, bullet list of value props, meeting CTA
- Closing: "Best," + signature
- Key phrases: "I'm reaching out because...", "Would you have 30 minutes...?", "Happy to work around your schedule"

## Email Structure

### Opening
- Greeting: "Hi [Name]," or "Hi [Company] team,"
- Brief pleasantry: "Hope 2026 is treating you well!"
- Self-introduction: Role at Postman, connection point
- Purpose: "I'm reaching out because..."

### Body
- What you'd like to discuss/learn
- Value proposition bullets (2-4 items):
  - Recent capabilities shipped
  - Relevant use cases
  - Specific opportunity for them

### Closing
- Meeting ask: "Would you have 30 minutes to connect in the next couple weeks?"
- Flexibility: "Happy to work around your schedule."
- Sign-off: "Best,"

## Example

**Request:** "Write a cold outreach email to Stripe about their API workspace"

**Output:**
Hi [Name],

Hope 2026 is treating you well! I'm David Cogan, Publisher Success Manager on the Postman API Network team.

I'm reaching out because I'd love to learn more about what's on Stripe's roadmap and see where the API Network can better support your goals.

On our end, we've recently shipped a few publisher capabilities I'm excited to share:

- Interactive notebooks that let developers follow hands-on API walkthroughs directly in Postman
- A revamped analytics experience with domain-level consumer data
- Support for MCP server publishing, enabling developers to connect your tools to AI agents

Would you have 30 minutes to connect in the next couple weeks? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
David
